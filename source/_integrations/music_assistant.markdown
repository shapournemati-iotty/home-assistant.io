The **Music Assistant**(MA) {% term integrations %} allows you to connect Home Assistant to a [Music Assistant Server](https://music-assistant.io/). Once configured, all [MA Players](https://music-assistant.io/player-support/) show up as Home Assistant [media player entities](/integrations/media_player/).  Media players will allow you to control media playback and see the currently playing item.

There is currently support for the following Home Assistant Platforms:

- [Media player](#media-player)

All of the Home Assistant [Media Player Control Actions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_player/#media-control-actions) are supported.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

### Manual configuration

Under normal circumstances, Home Assistant automatically discovers your running Music Assistant Server. If something special about the HA or MA setup (for example, the MA server is running as a remote Docker container) or discovery is not working, you can manually specify the URL to your Music Assistant server. 

## Media player

The Music Assistant media player creates media player entities for all players available in MA including those imported from Home Assistant. This is needed to provide the full functionality Music Assistant has to offer. These entities will display media information, playback progress, and playback controls.

### Action `media_player.play_media`

Play media hosted on a Music Assistant server on a Music Assistant player. The action configuration is as described in the [media player documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_player/#action-media_playerplay_media)

The `media_content_id` payload can be any of the following:

- The name of a track, artist or album. (for example, "Queen")
- A track or album combined with the artist name (for example, "Queen - Innuendo")
- A streaming provider URI (for example, `spotify://artist/12345`)

#### Examples

Play Adele's album 25

```yaml
entity_id: media_player.music_assistant_player
media_content_type: MUSIC
media_content_id: 'Adele - 25'
```

Play all tracks from Stevie Wonder in random order

```yaml
entity_id: media_player.music_assistant_player
media_content_type: MUSIC
media_content_id: 'Stevie Wonder'
```

Play the playlist The Best of Disco

```yaml
entity_id: media_player.music_assistant_player
media_content_type: PLAYLIST
media_content_id: 'The Best of Disco'
```
