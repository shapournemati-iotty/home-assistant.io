The Tesla Fleet API {% term integration %} exposes various sensors from Tesla vehicles and energy sites using the [Tesla Fleet API](https://developer.tesla.com/).

## Prerequisites

You must have a [Tesla](https://tesla.com) account, and a [Developer Application](https://developer.tesla.com/en_AU/dashboard).

### Developer Application

You must [create your own application](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api#step-2-create-an-application) for the Tesla Fleet API and configure it as an [application credential](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/application_credentials).
When creating the application, you must set the redirect URL to `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`, but the other URLs can be set as desired. You must also complete both [step 3](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api#step-3-generate-a-public-private-key-pair) and [step 4](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api/getting-started/what-is-fleet-api#step-4-call-the-register-endpoint) before the application will be able to make API calls.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Scopes

When connecting your Tesla account to Home Assistant, you **must** select the `Vehicle Information` or `Energy Product Information` scope. It is recommended you select all scopes for full functionality. The `Vehicle Location` scope was added in Home Assistant 2024.1, so any authorizations performed on previous releases that want this scope will need to be [modified](https://accounts.tesla.com/en_au/account-settings/security?tab=tpty-apps).

## Pay per use
	
Previously, Tesla restricted this integration to a very modest rate limit. However, from January 2025, accounts in eligible countries will be charged for every API call. Here's what you need to know:

- Tesla provides a $10 credit per developer account per calandar month
- Every vehicle coordinator refresh, vehicle command, and wake up has a cost
- This credit only allows for a maximum of 5000 coordinator refreshes
- Energy product APIs are free to use at this time
- To go beyond the free credit, you must provide payment details to Tesla

For more details please see [developer.tesla.com](https://developer.tesla.com).

## Command signing

Certain vehicles, including all vehicles manufactured since late 2023, require vehicle commands to be signed with a private key. All actions on vehicle entities will fail with an error if this is required and the key has not been added to the vehicle.

You will need to use Tesla's [command line tools](https://github.com/teslamotors/vehicle-command/blob/main/README.md#installation-and-configuration) to generate a key pair and install the public key on your vehicle using Bluetooth.

```shell
tesla-keygen -key-file tesla_fleet.key create > tesla_fleet.pem
tesla-control -ble -key-file tesla_fleet.key -vin VINVINVINVIN add-key-request tesla_fleet.pem owner cloud_key
```

Finally, copy `tesla_fleet.key` to your Home Assistant config directory and then reload the Tesla Fleet {% term integration %}.

## Entities

These are the entities available in the Tesla Fleet integration. Not all entities are enabled by default, and not all values are always available.

## Vehicle sleep

Constant API polling will prevent most Model S and Model X vehicles manufactured before 2021 from sleeping, so the integration will stop polling these vehicles for 15 minutes, after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can call the `homeassistant.update_entity` service to force polling the API, which will reset the timer.

## Energy dashboard

The Tesla Fleet API only provides power data for Powerwall and Solar products. This means they cannot be used on the energy dashboard directly.

Energy flows can be calculated from `Battery power` and `Grid power` sensors using a [Template Sensor](/integrations/template/) to separate the positive and negative values into positive import and export values.
The `Load power`, `Solar power`, and the templated sensors can then use a [Riemann Sum](/integrations/integration/) to convert their instant power (kW) values into cumulative energy values (kWh),
which then can be used within the energy dashboard.
